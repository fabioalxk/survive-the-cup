## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity first.** Prefer the simplest solution with the fewest lines of
   code — without losing functionality. Fewer lines = better.
2. **Minimal changes.** If a small edit solves the problem, make the small edit.
   Do not rewrite what already works.
3. **Solve it like a senior developer.** Think about consequences, edge cases,
   and maintainability before writing code.
4. **No workarounds, no fallbacks.** Fallbacks hide bugs. Data must be correct at
   the source. If you cannot do it cleanly, stop and ask for more logs or data
   instead of patching around the problem.
5. Garanta que o app ainda passa no build com yarn build

## Code Quality

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).** Never duplicate logic. Extract reusable
   functions, components, or constants instead of copy/paste.
2. **Reuse before creating.** Search the codebase for existing code that already
   does the job. Make an extra effort to reuse what is already there.
3. **Single Source of Truth.** Each piece of data has exactly one authoritative
   location.
4. **Early Return.** Exit early to avoid deep nesting.
5. **SOLID + Clean Code.** Apply where it improves clarity, not as ceremony.
6. **Remove dead code.** Delete unused or unreachable code once the task is done.
7. **One word per concept.** Pick a single verb for an action and use it
   everywhere.

   - ❌ `getUser`, `fetchOrder`, `retrieveProduct`
   - ✅ `getUser`, `getOrder`, `getProduct`

8. **English variable names.** All identifiers in English.

## State Management

1. **Centralize state.** Keep application state in a single central object rather
   than scattering updates across the codebase.
2. **Controlled mutations only.** Every state change goes through controlled
   functions. No direct, scattered mutations. This guarantees consistency,
   predictability, and easy debugging.

---

## File & Folder Conventions

1. **`src/` holds source code only.** Tests, fixtures, and tooling live outside
   `src/`.
2. Keep the directory structure flat and predictable. Group by feature when it
   helps navigation.

---

## Logging

1. **Do not remove logs** unless explicitly told to remove logs.
2. **Use `JSON.stringify`** for structured data in logs so they are easy to
   capture from the console.
3. Use the project's real logger API. Verify a logging function exists before
   calling it — do not assume helpers like `logger.info` are available.




## 13. Domain Rules / Business Logic

_<Project-specific rules the agent must never violate.>_


## Sobre o jogo
Acho que se for fazer simulações, melhor fazer com no maximo 200 jogos, para ir mais rapido, mesmo que tenha mais variancia

## Outros
Não fique fazendo animações desnecessarias. Só as que realmente forem necessárias
